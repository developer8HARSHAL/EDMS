# Simple EDMS - One Day Build Plan

## Project Overview

A basic Enterprise Document Management System using React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB with JWT authentication and role-based access control.

## Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Project Setup (9:00 - 9:30)

- [x] Create project repositories (frontend/backend)
- [x] Initialize package.json files
- [x] Install core dependencies

### Backend Foundation (9:30 - 11:00)

- [x] Set up Express server
- [x] Connect to MongoDB
- [x] Create database schemas:
    - [x] User schema (name, email, password, role)
    - [x] Document schema (name, path, size, type, uploadDate, owner, permissions)
- [x] Implement JWT authentication middleware

### API Development (11:00 - 12:00)

- [x] Create user routes:
    - [x] POST /api/users/register
    - [x] POST /api/users/login
    - [x] GET /api/users/profile
- [x] Create document routes:
    - [x] GET /api/documents (list documents)
    - [x] POST /api/documents (upload document)
    - [x] GET /api/documents/:id (download document)
    - [x] DELETE /api/documents/:id (delete document)

## Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Frontend Foundation (1:00 - 2:30)

- [x] Create React project with component structure
- [x] Set up React Router
- [x] Create auth context for user state management
- [x] Design basic UI components:
    - [x] Login/Register forms
    - [x] Navigation bar
    - [x] Document list
    - [x] Upload component

### Frontend Features (2:30 - 4:00)

- [x] Implement authentication flow
- [x] Create document management interface:
    - [x] Document listing with search filter
    - [x] Document upload with drag-and-drop (partially implemented)
    - [x] Document preview
    - [x] Delete functionality
- [x] Implement API service for backend communication

### Integration & Testing (4:00 - 5:00)

- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [x] Test user authentication
- [x] Test document upload and retrieval
- [x] Test search functionality (partially implemented)

## Evening (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

### Enhancement & Security (6:00 - 7:30)

- [x] Implement role-based access control
- [x] Add document sharing functionality
- [ ] Add request validation and sanitization
- [x] Implement proper error handling

### Refinement & Deployment (7:30 - 9:00)

- [ ] Style improvements and responsive design
- [ ] Fix bugs from testing
- [ ] Prepare for deployment
- [ ] Deploy to platform of choice (Heroku, Vercel, etc.)

## Current Status Summary

### Completed:
- Backend foundation is fully implemented including server setup, database connectivity, schemas, and authentication
- API endpoints for users and documents are working
- Frontend authentication system is robust and working (login, register, token handling)
- Document listing and basic management operations are implemented
- Role-based access control is in place

### In Progress / Partially Implemented:
- Document upload with drag-and-drop interface
- Search functionality needs further testing
- Error handling is implemented but may need refinement

### Remaining Tasks:
- Document preview functionality
- Additional request validation and sanitization
- UI/UX improvements for responsive design
- Bug fixing from testing
- Deployment preparation and execution
