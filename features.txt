## The Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) project contains the following core features:




##Core Functions of an EDMS

1. Document Storage: Secure, centralized storage for all organization documents
2. Version Control: Tracking changes and maintaining document history
3. Search & Retrieval: Quick access to documents through metadata and content search
4. Access Control: Role-based permissions for document security
5. Workflow Automation: Routing documents for approval, review, and processing
6. Audit Trails: Recording document access and changes for compliance
7. Integration: Connecting with other business systems like ERP or CRM
