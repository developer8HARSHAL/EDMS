# Simple EDMS - One Day Build Plan

## Project Overview

A basic Enterprise Document Management System using React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB with JWT authentication and role-based access control.

## Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Project Setup (9:00 - 9:30)

- [x]  Install core dependencies

### Backend Foundation (9:30 - 11:00)

- [x]  Set up Express server
- [x]  Connect to MongoDB
- [x]  Create database schemas:
    - [x]  User schema (name, email, password, role)
    - [x]  Document schema (name, path, size, type, uploadDate, owner, permissions)
- [x]  Implement JWT authentication middleware

### API Development (11:00 - 12:00)

- [x]  Create user routes:
    - [x]  POST /api/users/register
    - [x]  POST /api/users/login
    - [x]  GET /api/users/profile
- [x]  Create document routes:
    - [x]  GET /api/documents (list documents)
    - [x]  POST /api/documents (upload document)
    - [x]  GET /api/documents/:id (download document)
    - [x]  DELETE /api/documents/:id (delete document)

## Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Frontend Foundation (1:00 - 2:30)

- [ ]  Create React project with component structure
- [ ]  Set up React Router
- [ ]  Create auth context for user state management
- [ ]  Design basic UI components:
    - [ ]  Login/Register forms
    - [ ]  Navigation bar
    - [ ]  Document list
    - [ ]  Upload component

### Frontend Features (2:30 - 4:00)

- [ ]  Implement authentication flow
- [ ]  Create document management interface:
    - [ ]  Document listing with search filter
    - [ ]  Document upload with drag-and-drop
    - [ ]  Document preview
    - [ ]  Delete functionality
- [ ]  Implement API service for backend communication

### Integration & Testing (4:00 - 5:00)

- [ ]  Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ]  Test user authentication
- [ ]  Test document upload and retrieval
- [ ]  Test search functionality

## Evening (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

### Enhancement & Security (6:00 - 7:30)

- [ ]  Implement role-based access control
- [ ]  Add document sharing functionality
- [ ]  Add request validation and sanitization
- [ ]  Implement proper error handling

### Refinement & Deployment (7:30 - 9:00)

- [ ]  Style improvements and responsive design
- [ ]  Fix bugs from testing
- [ ]  Prepare for deployment
- [ ]  Deploy to platform of choice (Heroku, Vercel, etc.)

## Tech Stack Details

## Database Schema

### User Collection

```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  role: String (admin/user),
  createdAt: Date
}

```

### Document Collection

```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  originalName: String,
  path: String,
  size: Number,
  type: String,
  owner: ObjectId (ref: User),
  permissions: [
    {
      user: ObjectId (ref: User),
      access: String (read/write)
    }
  ],
  uploadDate: Date
}

```
